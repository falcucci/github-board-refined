This is an extension to improves your experience with [github projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) to manage your tasks with some new features, actions and layout enhancements to keep github more useful making automatic things for us - just because github it's an awesome tool and needs automation to really works well - also, product owners will thank us. 

After of use it for two or three months ago, me and my team had a great view of what the amazing workflow would be like involving stories, goals and initiatives to achieve our final purpose/value using github projects. Many thoughts about new features to make things easier. We tried other tools as well but you know that the integrations is not better then github itself.

## Install

- [**Chrome** extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-board-refined/ekojnklghbcfapjpedpnlcjeibjgdank)

## Usage

First, you need to change into the example subdirectory and install all
[NodeJS][nodejs] dependencies with [npm](http://npmjs.com/) or
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

    npm install

Start the continuous build process to transpile the code into something that
can run in Firefox or Chrome:

    npm run build

This creates a WebExtension in the `extension` subdirectory.
Any time you edit a file, it will be rebuilt automatically.

In another shell window, run the extension in Firefox using a wrapper
around [web-ext][web-ext]:

    npm start

Any time you edit a file, [web-ext][web-ext] will reload the extension
in Firefox. To see the popup, click the purple icon from the browser bar.
Here is what it looks like:

[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org/en/
[web-ext]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext

### Modules

Most of the active development is happening inside of small npm packages which are used by WebTorrent.

#### The Node Way&trade;

> "When applications are done well, they are just the really application-specific, brackish residue that can't be so easily abstracted away. All the nice, reusable components sublimate away onto github and npm where everybody can collaborate to advance the commons." â€” substack from ["how I write modules"](http://substack.net/how_I_write_modules)
